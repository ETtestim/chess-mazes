# Chess Mazes

**Chess Mazes** is a puzzle game that helps you visualize chess moves and avoid hanging pieces.

The game is based on the book ["Chess Mazes"](https://www.amazon.com/Chess-Mazes-Kind-Puzzle-Everyone/dp/1888690232) (2004) by Bruce Alberston.


## ‚ôüÔ∏è How to Play

The game is hosted at [chess-mazes.github.io/chess-mazes](https://chess-mazes.github.io/chess-mazes).

Either drag and drop the pieces to move them, or click a target square to move the selected piece to it. The goal is to check the black king without having your pieces threatened.

### üß© Custom Puzzles

You can load custom puzzles by entering a [FEN string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation) in the "Load FEN" dialog. If you have access to the original book, you can convert puzzles to FEN strings using tools such as [ChessVision.ai](https://chessvision.ai/).
