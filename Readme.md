## ‚ôüÔ∏è About

**Chess Mazes**  is a puzzle game that helps you visualize chess moves and avoid hanging pieces.
The game is based on the book  ["Chess Mazes"](https://www.amazon.com/Chess-Mazes-Kind-Puzzle-Everyone/dp/1888690232)  (2004) by Bruce Alberston.

### [](https://github.com/chess-mazes/chess-mazes#how-to-play) ü§ù How to Play
Either drag and drop the pieces to move them, or click a target square to move the selected piece to it. The goal is to check the black king without having your pieces threatened.

### [](https://github.com/chess-mazes/chess-mazes#custom-puzzles) üß© Custom Puzzles

You can load custom puzzles by entering a  [FEN string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)  in the "Load FEN" dialog. If you have access to the original book, you can convert puzzles to FEN strings using tools such as  [ChessVision.ai](https://chessvision.ai/).
